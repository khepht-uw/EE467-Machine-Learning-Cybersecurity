Spam Detection Lab

This folder contains the python code for Lab 1, where I created a machine learning model in the form
of a logistic regression classifier used for spam email detection. It processes a csv file containing
email contents as well as their class (spam / ham). It removes duplicates and unnecesary common words,
then creates a Bag of Words. This is what the model is trained on.

The instructions for this lab were provided by Professor Dinuka Sahabandu at the University of Washington
